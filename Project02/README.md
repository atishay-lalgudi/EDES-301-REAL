# EDES301 Project 2: 
Digital Etch-A-Sketch PCB is a custom two-layer printed circuit board designed in Autodesk EAGLE as part of the EDES301 course. The board interfaces a NUCLEO microcontroller development board with an Adafruit SPI LCD (Model 1770 or similar), providing analog input via two potentiometers for X/Y drawing control and digital input via two push buttons for functions such as clearing the screen or mode selection. Additional features include red, green, and blue status LEDs, a MicroSD card slot for saving or loading drawings, and dedicated headers for host board connectivity. The PCB follows standard manufacturing constraints, using 10 mil signal and 15 mil power traces, 12 mil drill / 24 mil diameter vias, and Gerber RS-274X files prepared for standard CAM fabrication.
