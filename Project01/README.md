# FPGA AI Pong Opponent
Running this project requires AMD Vivado version 2022.1 or earlier, as the FPGA board used is a Digilent Xilinx Basys 3 Board. Create a new project in AMD Vivado, taking all source files from [<Roger Qi's FPGA Pong Project>](<https://github.com/RogerQi/FPGA_Pong>) except top.v and main_game_coordinator.v. Additionally, use the constraint file in this github instead of Roger's. Once you have uploaded all the requisite source files and constraint files, synthesize, implement, generate the bitstream and upload it to the board (using a microUSB). Wire the Pmod JA module to the PocketBeagle's GPIOs as described in the Hackster (and also all hardware instructions described in the Hackster). Finally, run the python file in the PythonFiles folder on this github in your Cloud9IDE (while your pocketbeagle is up and running). At this point, you should be good to go!
